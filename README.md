# ReduxSimpleStarter

This project is based on the [Learning Redux](https://www.udemy.com/react-redux/) tutorial on Udemy made by Stephen Grider.

The original GitHub repo is : `https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter`

I first follow the tutorial, then I replace Youtube API by another one in order to improve my React / redux skills
